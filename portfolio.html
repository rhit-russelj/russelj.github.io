        <p>As part of the Rose Rocketry Team, it was inevitable that I would be building my own rocket, especially if <br> I wanted to be Level 1 High-Powered-Rocket certified! It was so awesome, and I had so much fun learning how to fly this high-powered rocket! <br> I am continuing to learn about rockets as I serve as the Secretary to the Rose Rocketry Team.</p>
