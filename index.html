    <h1>About Me:</h1>

    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>My name is Jessica Russell and I am a sophomore Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute
      of Technology. I currently participate in several clubs and design teams, most notably as the 
      Promotional/Sponsorship Lead for the Rose Grand Prix Engineering team and the Secretary to the Rose Rocketry
      Team. I have participated in numerous projects since starting at Rose, and have most recently worked 
      on building and launching a high-powered rocket. Despite not being my most usual subject for a project,
      it was certainly one of the more exciting ones.
    </p>
    <p>However, regardless of the engineering work I currently immerse myself in, I am also an artist, and have been for most of my life.
      I absolutely love art at any level, and I am particularly practiced in digital and traditional style artwork. I can get carried
      away in designs and tend to develop story lines and plots in my free time. I have also gained
      experience in making promotional fliers, logos, extensive designs (for engineering as well as story creation), and complete visual
      media in the form of digital mockups, comics, animation, etc.
